                <p>I'm a sophomore computer science student studying at the University of Michigan.</p>
                <p>I'm currently 20 years old, and I've been programming for 1.5 years. I came into UofM as a 
                    freshman intending to do electrical engineering, but after taking a project based class where we had
                    to make a drone fly through a given course autonomously, I quickly fell in love with coding. 
                    Here's a video of our drone flying through the course!

                <p>(It was pretty basic C++ code as it was an intro-engineering course, but we still think it's awesome)</p>
